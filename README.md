There are three test cases assignments each with their own main.py.  Test_one has an associated.csv that will be used for analysis.

Prepare to spend up to four hours on this

You may use AI agents to support your coding, but please be prepared to discuss your reasoning and code in the interview

Assignment Steps:
1. pull this repo (easier than copy/pasting)

2. For the TO DOs, please write your code underneath each
You can makes changes in the main.py themselves or make a new .py file with your code

3. Once you are satisfied with your code please email a zip file to chanley@guzmanenergy.com and sjbeuning@guzmanenergy.com

If you have any questions feel free to email us as well 

Thank you and look forward to seeing what you can come up with!
